## Project goals

Based on weather conditions, help a drone photography pilot answer the following questions:

- Can I fly at X location today?
- What about the next 7 days?
- How does Y location compare, better or worse?
- Which date/site combinations are best so I can plan my week?

Typically, the best conditions are:

- daylight
- light to no wind
- no precipitation
- low humidity
- moderate temperatures
  - too cold and batteries suffer
  - too hot and electronics overheat

## Roadmap

### Core

- [ ] get forecast for a given location (today)
  - [ ] sunrise / sunset time
  - [ ] wind speed (average during daylight)
  - [ ] temperature / humidity (average during daylight)
  - [ ] precipitation (average during daylight)
  - [ ] invent some kind of at-a-glance aggregate indicator
- [ ] get multi-day forecast for a given location / date
- [ ] show simple map of location

### Stretch

- [ ] allow multiple locations
- [ ] more in-depth data visualization

  - [ ] sunrise / sunset time
  - [ ] wind speed over time
  - [ ] temperature / humidity over time

- [ ] user authentication
- [ ] save multiple locations to user account

<!-- When looking for a code sample, we would like to see a webapp that:
1. Has strong modern web development fundamentals like:
    1. Component-driven development,
    2. State management & data flow, and
    3. Language fundamentals & effective patterns;
2. Includes CRUD interaction with data like:
    1. Accessing remote APIs,
    2. Consuming dynamic data, and
    3. Error handling; and
3. Presents well to both users and other developers with:
    1. Components that show dynamic data,
    2. Appropriate documentation, code legibility, code comments, etc., and
    3. A good, usable UI.
Note: Our preference is to have a code sample in Javascript that can be compiled and run. -->
